                <br>
                <p>Raised in Normandy, Claede Monet was introduced to plein-air
                    painting by Eugène Boudin, known for paintings of the resorts
                    that dotted the region&apos;s Channel coast, and subsequently
                    studied informally with the Dutch landscapist Johan Jongkind
                    (1819&lowbar;1891). When he was twenty-two, Monet joined the
                    Paris studio of the academic history painter Charles Gleyre.
                    His classmates included Auguste Renoir, Frédéric Bazille,
                    and other future Impressionists. Many rejections from
                    exhibitions inspired Monet to join with Edgar Degas, Édouard
                    Manet, Camille Pissarro, Renoir, and others in establishing an
                    independent exhibition in 1874. Impression, Sunrise (1873; Musée Marmottan Monet,
                    Paris), one of Monet&apos;s contributions to this exhibition, drew particular scorn for the
                    unfinished appearance of its loose handling and indistinct forms. Yet the artists saw the
                    criticism as a badge of honor, and subsequently called themselves “Impressionists” after
                    the painting&apos;s title, even though the name was first used derisively.
                    Monet found subjects in his immediate surroundings, as he painted the people and
                    places he knew best, families and friends. His homes and gardens became gathering
                    places for friends, including Manet and Renoir, who often painted alongside their host.
                    Yet Monet&apos;s paintings cast a surprisingly objective eye on these scenes, which include
                    few signs of domestic relations.
                    Shortly after Monet died (a wealthy and well-respected man at the age of eighty-six), the
                    French government installed his last water-lily series in specially constructed galleries at
                    the Orangerie in Paris, where they remain today.
